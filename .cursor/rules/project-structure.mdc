# Project Structure Guide

This personal site is organized with the following structure:

## Content
- Content files are stored in [src/content/](mdc:src/content)
- The main memories content is defined in [memories.json](mdc:src/content/memories.json)
- Each memory entry should have a title and ISO 8601 formatted date

## Best Practices
1. Keep JSON content files clean and well-formatted
2. Use ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) for all timestamps
3. Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces) in JSON files
4. Avoid comments in JSON files
5. Keep memory titles concise and descriptive

## File Organization
- All source code should be in the `src/` directory
- Content files should be in `src/content/`
- Build artifacts should be in `dist/` or `build/`
- Configuration files should be in the root directory

## Security Guidelines
1. Never commit sensitive information to JSON files
2. Keep API keys and credentials in environment variables
3. Validate all user input before processing
4. Use secure headers and HTTPS for all requests
