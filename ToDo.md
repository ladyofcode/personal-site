# To Do

[] Add the journal embellishments (stickers, tape, and text)
[] Add washi tape to the map (top and bottom)
[] Split the about pages into different sections
[] Add some 'stickers'
[] Update the map colours
[] Ensure the borders/spacing on everything align (100D tag, titles on homepage, modal content, pane content)
[] Make the background darker so the sticker borders show up better as white
[] Add some torn collage text to the background
[] Add some drawn borders to the images
[] Add some 'hand-written' quotes to the page
[] Automate 100D posting

Map quirks to bear in mind:
- Contains small countries (why is this even a quirk)
- Separated France + French Guiana
- Separated Spain + Canary Islands
- Check full vs partial name (United Republic of Tanzania)
