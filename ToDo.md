# To Do

## About page


## Log page
[x] Build out the map
[x] Fix the tiles
[x] Clickable map
[x] Rename world.ts to worldGeometry.ts
[] Create some entry data for the Log; same file gets used for map + Memories list
[] Generate the Memories list (chronological order)
[] Add the popup to the Leaflet map
[] Find out if ordering the Memories list by country or chronology is better
[x] Colour only countries with content
[x] Limit zooming to countries with content
[] Remove hoverable cursor on countries without content
[] Only zoom in once; on mobile country should in the middle, on desktop country should be on the right
[] Add the panel mechanism for content
