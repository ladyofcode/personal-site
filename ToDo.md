# To Do

[] Update About page
[] Update the country geojson
[] Create some entry data for the Log; same file gets used for map + Memories list
[] Generate the Memories list (chronological order)
[] Add the panel popup to the Leaflet map
[] Colour only countries with content
[] Limit zooming to countries with content
[] Remove hoverable cursor on countries without content
[] Only zoom in once; on mobile country should in the middle, on desktop country should be on the right
[] Add pins to countries (some are too small to hover over)
[] Add the journal embellishments (stickers, tape, and text)
