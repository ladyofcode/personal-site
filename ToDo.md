# To Do

[x] Update the country geojson
[x] Create some entry data for the Log; same file gets used for map + Memories list
[x] Generate the Memories list (chronological order)
[x] Add pins to countries (some are too small to hover over)
[x] Colour only countries with content
[x] Remove hoverable cursor on countries without content
[x] Limit zooming to countries with content
[] Only zoom in once; on mobile country should be in the middle, on desktop country should be on the right
[x] Add the panel popup to the Leaflet map
[x] Update About page
[] Add the journal embellishments (stickers, tape, and text)
[] Escape room reviews (markdown?)
[] Automate 100D posting

Map quirks to bear in mind:
- Contains small countries (why is this even a quirk)
- Separated France + French Guiana
- Separated Spain + Canary Islands
- Check full vs partial name (United Republic of Tanzania)
