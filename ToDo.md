# To Do

[x] Update the homepage SVGs
[x] Update the map colours
[x] Make the background darker so the sticker borders show up better as white
[x] Split the about pages into different sections (or decorate them like a journal)
[] Stop main map from scrolling around too much
[] Ensure the borders/spacing on everything align (100D tag, titles on homepage, modal content, pane content)
[] Add some torn collage text to the background
[x] Add washi tape to the map (top and bottom)
[] Add the journal embellishments (stickers, tape, and text)
[] Add some 'stickers'
[] Add some drawn borders to the images
[] Add some quotes to the page
[] Automate 100D posting

Map quirks to bear in mind:
- Contains small countries (why is this even a quirk)
- Separated France + French Guiana
- Separated Spain + Canary Islands
- Check full vs partial name (United Republic of Tanzania)
