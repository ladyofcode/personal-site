# To Do

[xD] Update the country geojson
[] Create some entry data for the Log; same file gets used for map + Memories list
[] Generate the Memories list (chronological order)
[] Add pins to countries (some are too small to hover over)
[] Colour only countries with content
[] Remove hoverable cursor on countries without content
[] Limit zooming to countries with content
[] Only zoom in once; on mobile country should be in the middle, on desktop country should be on the right
[] Add the panel popup to the Leaflet map
[] Update About page
[] Add the journal embellishments (stickers, tape, and text)
[] Escape room reviews (markdown?)
